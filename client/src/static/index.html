                        <p>Outfox is an open-source educational platform that encourages the betterment of its users through the 
                            dissemination of instructive content. Unlike privately accessible platforms like Blackboard and Moodle, 
                            Outfox provides all users with the opportunity to access all available content, as well as to make 
                            meaningful contributions. As a platform that is user-centric, the user has the power to find groups 
                            that interest them, join groups, and add resources to it in their own personal view as they see fit. 
                            Everyone can interact with the content and make their own changes, make comments, and tailor their 
                            educational experience to what works best for them.

                        <p>Outfox is a Marist College capping project whose production began in the Fall of 2020. Every year since then, it
                            has been passed down and perfected by students of following classes.
                            <br><br>
                            Within the next coming years, Outfox is set to debut!

                        <p>Learning is at our core, we do it everyday. The artifacts of what we learn, our notes, papers,
                            links we find, videos we watch, blogs we read, spreadsheets, test results, assignments, books,
                            and our lifetime of interactions with teachers and mentors are spread across the physical and
                            digital world.
                            <br><br>
                            When we graduate, finish an online course, complete a training seminar, attend a conference or
                            even just switch to a new method of managing our notes and documents we lose something,
                            pieces of our hard work scattered, unorganized, out of reach and eventually lost. Often years
                            later we find ourselves frustrated and retracing our steps though a past learning or research
                            journey only to realize a crucial piece cannot be located or reconstructed.
                            <br><br>
                            We need a single, open, collaborative and forever free environment where we can conduct our
                            learning, research our ideas, and remember all the lessons we learn, forever. An environment
                            that is not owned by an academic institution or corporation but by everyone. Guided only by
                            virtue and principles:
                            <br><br>
