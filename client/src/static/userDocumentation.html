                        <p>Outfox is an open-source educational platform that encourages the betterment of its users through the
                            dissemination of instructive content. Unlike institutionally controlled learning platforms such as Blackboard or Google
                            Classroom, Outfox gives all users the ability to access and manage educational resources like never before.
                            As a platform that is user-centric, the user has the power to explore, join,
                            and customize groups with their own resources. Everyone can interact with the content by making changes, comments,
                            and connections with other users to tailor their educational experience to what works best for them.
                        </p>
                    <h2 id = "users" class = "sub_header"> Users</h2>
                        <p>Unlike most other educational platforms which make a sharp distinction between students and teachers, Outfox
                            only has users making it easier for everyone to collaborate and share resources.  As a user you can create
                            and customize groups with your own resources and thoes provided by your friends, teachers, colleagues and classmantes.
                        </p>
                    <h2 id = "resources" class = "sub_header"> Resources</h2>
                        <p>Resources are an important part of any educational platform.  They are what allows teachers to share important information
                            with students and help to promote learning.  Normally once a class ends the students lose access to these resources, however
                            Outfox aims to change that.  Outfox users never lose
                            access to groups they are apart of meaning they can access any resources from those groups at any point. Users can also upload
                            their own resources enbaling them to share knowlege across the site.
                        </p>
                    <h2 id = "groups" class = "sub_header"> Groups</h2>
                        <p>Similar to classrooms in other educational platforms groups act as way to share and group information.  Unlike most educational
                            platforms however any user can create a group.  The benefit of this is that students can group resources from a number of classes
                            to create their own unique group with resources from years of school.  This also allows the user to create groups and add resources and
                            other users to topics that are unrelated to their currents studies that they may be interested in.  This feature helps to promote growth
                            and learning while allowing a number of users to help and collaborate along the way.
