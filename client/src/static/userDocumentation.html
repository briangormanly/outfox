                        <p>Outfox is an open-source educational platform that encourages the betterment of its users through the 
                            dissemination of instructive content. Unlike privately accessible platforms like Blackboard and Moodle, 
                            Outfox provides all users with the opportunity to access all available content, as well as to make 
                            meaningful contributions. As a platform that is user-centric, the user has the power to find groups 
                            that interest them, join groups, and add resources to it in their own personal view as they see fit. 
                            Everyone can interact with the content and make their own changes, make comments, and tailor their 
                            educational experience to what works best for them. 
                        </p>

                        <p>Unlike most other educational platforms which make a sharp distinction between students and teachers, Outfox 
                            only has users making it easier for everyone to collaborate and share resources.  As a user you can create 
                            and customize groups and store resources in your account as well as add them to groups for other members of 
                            the group to view.
                        </p>
                    <h2 id = "resources" class = "sub_header"> Resources</h2>
                        <p>Resources are an important part of any educational platform.  They are what allows teachers to share important information
                            with students and help to promote learning.  Normally once a class ends the students lose access to these resources, however 
                            Outfox aims to change that.  In Outfox a user can save resources that they find intersting or important.  Also users never lose 
                            access to groups they were apart of meaning they can access any resources from those groups at any point.
                        </p>
                    <h2 id = "groups" class = "sub_header"> Groups</h2>
                        <p>Similar to classrooms in other educational platforms groups act as way to share and group information.  Unlike most educational 
                            platforms however any user can create a group.  The benefit of this is that students can group resources from a number of classes
                            to create their own unique group with resources from years of school.  This also allows the user to create groups and add resources and
                            other users to topics that are unrelated to their currents studies that they may be interested in.  This feature helps to promote growth 
                            and learning while allowing a number of users to help and collaborate along the way.
