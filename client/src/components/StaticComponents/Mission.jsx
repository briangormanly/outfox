                <p>Learning is at our core, we do it everyday. The artifacts of what we learn, our notes, papers,
                    links we find, videos we watch, blogs we read, spreadsheets, test results, assignments, books,
                    and our lifetime of interactions with teachers and mentors are spread across the physical and
                    digital world.<br /><br />

                    When we graduate, finish an online course, complete a training seminar, attend a conference or
                    even just switch to a new method of managing our notes and documents we lose something,
                    pieces of our hard work scattered, unorganized, out of reach and eventually lost. Often years
                    later we find ourselves frustrated and retracing our steps though a past learning or research
                    journey only to realize a crucial piece cannot be located or reconstructed.<br /><br />

                    We need a single, open, collaborative and forever free environment where we can conduct our
                    learning, research our ideas, and remember all the lessons we learn, forever. An environment
                    that is not owned by an academic institution or corporation but by everyone. Guided only by
                    virtue and principles:<br /><br />

                    <strong>The Perfect Learning Platform:</strong>
                    <br /><br />
                    <strong>❖ Accessible:</strong> Free and open source and will remain so forever
                    <br /><br />
                    <strong>❖ User, not institution centric:</strong> Lifelong learners require a lifelong system that follows them
                    <br /><br />
                    <strong>❖ Flexible:</strong> So different types of learners can work however they do best
                    <br /><br />
                    <strong>❖ Social:</strong> Opening a safe central hub of learning means collaboration and sharing of information can be easier than ever
                    <br /><br />
                    <strong>❖ Safe:</strong> Your data will never be used against you, only for you. It will not be sold or used for marketing and is only seen by people you authorize
                    <br /><br />
                    <strong>❖ Smart:</strong> It is intuitive to use and can suggest helpful resources getting you closer to the answers you seek
                    <br /><br />
                    <strong>❖ Listens:</strong> To its users, the sum of its parts and always remains a force for good
                    <br /><br />
