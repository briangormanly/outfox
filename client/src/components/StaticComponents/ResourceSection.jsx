                <p>Resources are an important part of any educational platform.  They are what allows teachers to share important information
                    with students and help to promote learning.  Normally once a class ends the students lose access to these resources, however
                    Outfox aims to change that.  Outfox users never lose
                    access to groups they are apart of meaning they can access any resources from those groups at any point. Users can also upload
                    their own resources enbaling them to share knowlege across the site.
