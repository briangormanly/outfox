### `npm run devts`

Runs nodemon to focus on the TypeScript directory. So, if you save while runningt his it will recompile it to JavaScript and run it for you.

The page will reload if you make edits to the TypeScript.<br />
You will also see any errors in the console.

### `npm run devjs`
Similar to the devts command except that it only watches for changes in the JavaScript that is transpiled. If you would like to only restart after you compile your TypeScript then this is the option.

The page will reload if you make edits to the JavaScript.<br />
You will also see any errors in the console.

### `npm run lint`
Runs your TypeScript code against the TSLinter and tells you any suggestions on how to improve your code. An example would be using a standard for loop instead of for-of loop on an object that is iterable. It will display the suggestions in the log.
